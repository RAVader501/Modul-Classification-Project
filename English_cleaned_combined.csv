"Secure Operational Control of Large-Scale Renewable Energy Systems and Power Grids","7, 9, 11, 13","The European Union (EU) targets a reduction of CO2 emissions from 80 % up to 95 % by the year 2050. The massive increase and integration of renewable energy plays a key role in this strategy. The results of the EU research project “eHighway2050” show how to develop a trans-European grid that will interconnect hydropower from Scandinavia, wind power from Germany and solar power from Spain and Italy to bring the green power to the consumers. All EU countries contribute and share their resources.

"Computer Modeling, Simulation, and Control of Renewable Energy Systems","7, 9, 11","Energy systems are undergoing a profound and worldwide transformation. This can be rapidly recognized by considering some examples: •	Fossil-fuel-based power plants are being replaced by renewables, complemented by storage.  •	The century-old battle of alternating current versus modern direct current solutions just makes a comeback. •	Power electronic converters dramatically increase the opportunities of high-speed control. •	Microgrids appear in the developing world for covering local needs such as cell phone charging and cooling; but simultaneously, there are already plans for a massive power grid spanning the entire globe. •	Synergies among technology sectors give rise to new concepts such as vehicle-to-grid or power-to-heat. These are significant trends. Or are there even better alternatives? How do we make sure that the resulting systems are efficient and secure? What will happen if there is a fault? These and similar questions can only be answered if there are the right models for the computer-aided analysis and design of energy systems available. But what do we know about the availability of suitable models? One part of the answer is that there are some good tools with helpful models available. The other part of the answer is that there are many models missing and that the quality of specific existing models should be improved. In any case, knowledge on the computer modeling of renewable energy systems is very valuable and forward-looking. Engineers and scientists need such knowledge for informed decision making regarding the renewable energy systems of today and tomorrow. It is this kind of knowledge that the participants of the course will acquire. A particularly important part of the modeling is concerned with the analysis of the dynamic behavior of the energy systems. For this purpose, computer programs represent the dynamic state equations by their discrete counterparts through the application of numerical integration. Different numerical integration methods do exist, and those have different features and so give different results. For the correct usage of simulation tools, the basic knowledge of simulation methods is therefore extremely valuable. For this reason, the module begins with an introduction of this topic. It will become evident that the correct usage has significant implications on the quality of the solution. We will also discuss this in the context of real-time simulation for control system testing. Students will get to know the significance of simulation by developing an own small network simulator in the practice sessions. Very insightful is the modeling of energy systems with very high shares of renewable power injection of 60 %, 80 %, or even 100 %. The given power electronics for converting DC into AC is then able to respond to faults und start system-wide control actions at very high speeds. Some of the known simulation techniques would give wrong results at such high shares of renewables. In the module, it is shown how to model these 100 % renewable energy systems correctly. Furthermore, it is investigated how new technologies such as power-to-heat can be integrated into the simulation, too."

"Algorithmic Graph Structure Theory","4, 9","Students completing the course will understand how structural information about instances to computational problems can be used in the design of efficient algorithms. They will be familiar with basic notions of graph decompositions and the algorithmic techniques facilitated to use this additional information. Many algorithmic problems on graphs are NP-hard and therefore there is good evidence that no efficient algorithms solving these problems on all graphs exist. Classical examples are routing problems arising e.g. in integrated circuit layout and design, colouring problems in scheduling applications or domination problems in facility location. However, instances to these problems arising in practical applications may have more ”structure“ than general graphs, e.g. instances may be “hierarchical” or “tree-like”. Using this additional structural information may help in designing efficient algorithms for solving problems in instances of this form. A particularly good example are instances which are planar graphs, i.e. graphs that can be drawn without crossing edges. Planar graphs arise for instance in routing applications, as many road or train maps are nearly planar. It turns out that if the input instance is planar, or a tree, then many hard problems become tractable. In this course we will study methods for solving algorithmic problems on restricted classes of graphs. The most important cases will be planar graphs and graph classes defined by the concept of bounded tree-width. We will then extend this to even more general classes of graphs. The focus of this lecture is to introduce the structural properties of graphs that can be employed in the design of efficient algorithms and to present the algorithmic techniques needed for this."

In that context the requirements to these systems to ensure a secure and reliable program execution even in malicious environments are constantly increasing. These requirements can often be fulfilled with special hardware only. Modern CPUs and platforms provide with e.g. La Grande (Intel) and Trustzone (ARM) hardware extensions which make construction of such systems feasible.

Furthermore, every participant acquires profound knowledge in his confined topic. Please attend two lectures or a lecture plus a seminar to complete the module. Lectures a) Internet Control Plane and Software-Defined Networks:  The Internet has evolved in recent years into a conceptual two layer architecture, where the control protocols constitute the Control Plane and the basic OSI layer protocols such as IP and the link layer constitute the Data Plane. In practice, the Control Plane protocols use the Data Plane protocols for distribution and mainly run over the same network as the Data Plane, but the conceptual separation is convenient for clarifying thinking about how the Internet works. In this course, we will explore the Control Plane protocols in three different routing domains: the wide area network, the data center, and the wireless network. After a short review of the Internet architecture, the IP and link layer, we will take up the basics of IP routing and look at routing in the wide area network through the routing protocols RIP, OSPF, and BGP, and discuss how operators use MPLS for traffic engineering. Then we will switch to data center networks, and see how overlay/virtual networks solve the fundamental problems. Here, we will also discuss the recent paradigms of software-defined networks and programmable dataplanes (P4). Finally, we will focus on wireless networks, specifically access point-based WiFi and the modern LTE/Evolved Packet core network for cellular. b) „ Internet and Network Security:  As common utilization of the Internet broadens, the threat from malicious programs and Users increases.

For this purpose, classical transistor (MOS, bipolar) circuit design and high-frequency RF design are combined together and applied with industry-standard design software and technologies (CMOS, SiGe). In addition to the analysis, the course teaches and strengthens skills in design synthesis (i.e. the circuit implementation) of high-frequency amplifiers for radio front-ends, including receivers (low-noise amplifiers), and transmitters (power amplifiers). In this context, synthesis also means, in particular, the design flow for the optimization and validation of the mixed-signal RF circuit design, including the layout and post-layout verification methods, to finally give the designed circuits to a semiconductor Fab for production. This will indeed happen thanks to the support of IHP Leibniz Institute, Frankfurt (Oder). MMIC4U (Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit for YOU): Together with the IHP Leibniz Institute, the three types of classes are organized in such a way that the chip designs are produced between the two semesters. Thereby, each student group receives their own fabricated chip design during the second semester. The first semester focuses on applied theory including design calculations, circuit topologies, and design tool tutorials (MMIC4U Chip Class), as well as the actual design project with guidance in our student design lab (MMIC4U Chip Project) - the target is the design and implementation of a 5 GHz low-noise amplifier completed for fabrication, as a vital component of WiFi transceiver circuits. The focus of the second semester is to conduct guided experimental lab evaluations (MMIC4U Chip Lab). In a natural lab environment, students can learn basic analysis and measurement methods and apply them on their own chip. Thus, the students are getting the experience of a complete design, production and characterization cycle."

"Graph Minors","4","After completion of this course students will have a profound understanding of the concepts, ideas and intermediate steps of the proof of the graph minor structure theorem. They will be able to identify the main steps in the proof and will be able to apply these ideas and results in other areas and applications. Among the most important results in modern combinatorics is Robertson and Seymour's proof of the graph minor theorem, commonly known as Wagner's conjecture. One way of stating this result is as follows: in every infinite class of finite undirected simple graphs there are two graphs H and G such that H is a minor of G. To prove this result, Robertson and Seymour developed a deep structure theory of graphs in terms of the graph minor relation. Several concepts, ideas and intermediate results developed as part of this theory have found numerous applications in other areas of mathematics, computer science and beyond. In fact, the impact of concepts such as the tree width"" of a graph and its dual concepts of ""brambles"" or ""grid minors"" has been so pervasive that one could say that entirely new fields of research have emerged based on these ideas. The structure theory developed as part of the graph minor project culminates in Robertson and Seymour's famous structure theorem for graphs excluding a fixed minor. Informally it says that every graph G  1. is somewhat similar to a tree (formalised by the notion of ""tree width"") or 2. contains a large complete graph as a minor or 3. can be decomposed into a tree of subgraphs of (almost) bounded genus (slightly more pecisely: has a tree decomposition whose pieces can almost be embedded into a fixed surface (into which G itself cannot be embedded of course)). This theorem is not only interesting from a structural perspective but has deep implication in the theory of graph algorithms.  Despite its enormous complexity, the proof of the structure theorem follows a clear route with clearly identifiable intermediate steps, which are important in their own right. Furthermore, many results along the way can be understood on an intuitive level and many of them can be applied algorithmically as a black-box. That is, even without understanding or even reading their proof one can apply them in many algorithmic settings. Finally, many steps of the proof are not only very interesting, or important, the underlying concepts and ideas are often simply stunning in their mathematical beauty making the study of graph minors an exciting endeavour. In this course we will cover all essential aspects of the proof of the graph minor structure theorem. Starting with essentially no prerequisites we will introduce the fundamental concepts of tree width and grid minors, surfaces and surface embeddings, and then develop the proof of the structure theorem over the period of the course."""

They are able to position ethics with regard to other regulation systems. They know and are able to analyse the main arguments brought forward by different positions with regard to exemplary current fields of socio-technical systems involving computational technology, in particular data science and networked AI, and the effects these systems have on individuals and society. They can describe, compare and assess exemplary frameworks and techniques intended to integrate (explicit) values into systems “by design”. They can make and argue choices they would (or do) make as data scientists. They are able to take a critical attitude to the choices they make with regard to these dimensions, and to argue their position. They know relevant professional codes of conduct, they know how to compare them with one another, and they are able to assess and argue to what extend and why they are bound to them.  Students are able to read, understand and present state-of-the-art research in a selected field of data science / AI with ethical impact. They are able to independently and systematically connect their substantiated understanding of the technological aspects of these research works with the competencies learned in the present course. They are also able to read this work critically, i.e. to identify where the authors position themselves (whether explicitly or implicitly) with regard to the ethical impact of their work, to question this stance, and to identify gaps and opportunities for future work. They are able to present their analysis in a way that exposes relevant inherent dilemmas and that engages their seminar audience in an exploration of the multifaceted nature of the ethical problems raised. The impact of computer science and related fields on our society and everyday life has increased tremendously, and computer scientists should therefore be aware of the societal and morally relevant impact of the artifacts they build and of the systems they contribute to. This awareness can be trained and sharpened. Furthermore, computer scientists ought to have the necessary competencies for making morally acceptable and professional decisions in the development processes they are participating in. The thoughts and insights of academic ethics - i.e. the field professionally concerned with ethics and morals - are a necessary precondition for these competencies, and they are a necessary counterpart to the technical understanding and competencies that computer scientists bring to design. This course aims at bringing these two perspectives together. It will introduce relevant knowledge from the field of academic moral philosophy as well as soft skills needed to argue clearly, precisely, and convincingly (i.e. beyond the level of everyday discussions at bars and parties). You will learn how to apply these skills to problems that will surface at many points in your career -  whether in research, industry, or other fields. The ideas will be explained, and the skills trained, through analyses of several currently much discussed fields and phenomena linked to technologies from data science and networked AI. Ethical problems often present dilemmas and raise substantial controversy. In the seminar component of this course, you will evaluate state-of-the-art research papers and present them in ways that demonstrate your competencies and involve the audience in a meaningful controversy, showing how intellectually stimulating and fun a serious engagement with ethics can be.   This course covers:  - an introduction to the methods of philosophy, argumentation theory, and the basics of normative as well as applied ethics;  - an introduction to the schools of ethics that are commonly used to assess what is “right” or “wrong” in choices related to computational technology; - the role of ethics in relation to other regulations such as law and industry self-regulation; - starting points to evaluate practices and technologies already in use or not that far away, such as: surveillance and tracking (online, GPS, CCTV, …); big data, machine learning and predictive analytics and phenomena created by them, including filter bubble effects/echo chambers and bias/discrimination; autonomous vehicles;  - an overview of relevant choices that need to be made by data scientists, and principled approaches to making these choices based on ethical reasoning; - selected design frameworks and techniques that are intended to “bake ethics into” systems, such as value-sensitive design or privacy by design; - a guide through the multitude of ethics-related codes of professional associations;  - an outlook onto the question of whether machines themselves can be ethical agents."

"Current Topics in Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Networks","4, 9, 17","The successful completion of the seminar enables the participants to understand recent, complex, and professional literature and to summarize the work. Furthermore, every participant acquires profound knowledge in his/her small topic. Blockchain technology enables mistrusting entities to cooperate in the absence of a trusted third party. The technology also forms the basis of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. A main challenge faced by current blockchains however regards their scalability: the usual example in the literature is that while custodian payment systems can easily support thousands of transactions per second, blockchains currently merely support tens of transactions per second. By allowing users to make payments directly, without global consensus protocols and withing having to commit transactions on the blockchain, emerging off-chain networks, also known as payment channel networks or second-layer blockchain networks, can greatly improve the scalability of cryptocurrency payment systems. Indeed, over the last years, off-chain networks such as Bitcoin Lightning, Ethereum Raiden, and XRP Ripple, to just name a few, have received great interest. The goal of this seminar is to get an understanding of the state-of-the-art technology behind blockchain and cryptocurrency networks. To this end, we will critically discuss recent scientific publications in this area, review open-source implementations, and study whether existing methodologies and evaluations can be reproduced. The seminar hence will consist of discussions, presentations and hands-on and research components. The seminar revolve around fundamental problems and design principles.
